### Project Overview

 Project:- Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones(1/8)

Problem Statement

The Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed.

Why solve this project ?

This project comprises of exercises and tasks which will make you familiar and give you an in-depth knowledge of how and when to apply support vector machine algorithm moreover it will give you additional experience to fine tune your model and improve the predicting power even more.

You will learn to explore data insights in depth

You will learn to implement Support Vector Machines

You will learn to perform feature selection with the help of Support Vector Machines

You will learn to find best suitable hyperparameters with the help of grid search providing better understanding of the usage of hyperparmeter tuning.
