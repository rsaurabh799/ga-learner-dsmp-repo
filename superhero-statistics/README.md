### Project Overview

 Problem Statement

The rise of superheroes and supervillains is at an all time high. The 'Academy of Super Beings(ASB)' was formed to bring order to it. We have with us the data of more than 500 super humans but we need your knowledge of descriptive statistics in figuring out the important insights from it.

The dataset has details of 594 super hero characters with the following 17 features.

Feature Description ID Unique character ID Name Name of the character Gender Male/Female Intelligence Intelligence points of the character Strength Strength points of the character Speed Speed points of the character Durability Durability points of the character Power Power points of the character Combat Combat points of the character Total Total sum of all the above points of the character Height Height of the character(-99 value equates to 'immeasurable') Weight Weight of the character(-99 value equates to 'immeasurable') SkinColor Skin color of the the character EyeColor Eye color of the character HairColor Hair color of the character Race Which race the character belongs to
