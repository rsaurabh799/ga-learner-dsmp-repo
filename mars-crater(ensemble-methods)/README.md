### Project Overview

 Project:-Mars Crater

This dataset was generated using HRSC nadir panchromatic image h0905_0000 taken by the Mars Express spacecraft. The images is located in the Xanthe Terra, centered on Nanedi Vallis and covers mostly Noachian terrain on Mars. The image had a resolution of 12.5 meters/pixel.

Problem statement:- Determine if the instance is a crater or not a crater. 1=Crater, 0=Not Crater

We construct a attribute vector for each crater candidate using Haar-like attributes described by Papageorgiou 1998. These attributes are simple texture attributes which are calculated using Haar-like image masks that were used by Viola in 2004 for face detection consisting only black and white sectors. The value of an attribute is the difference between the sum of gray pixel values located within the black sector and the white sector of an image mask. The figure below shows nine image masks used in our case study. The first five masks focus on capturing diagonal texture gradient changes while the remaining four masks on horizontal or vertical textures.
