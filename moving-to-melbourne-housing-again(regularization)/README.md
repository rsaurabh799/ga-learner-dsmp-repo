### Project Overview

 Project:-Moving to Melbourne - Housing Again!

Problem Statement

Your friend from Iowa, whose housing problem you solved, is now moving to Melbourne for a new assignment Down Under. As you have solved his Iowa housing problem so well, he wants you to solve his Melbourne housing problem too. Armed with your new-found expertise in regularization, let's work on the Melbourne housing data using regularized regression. Each observation is a different house attribute with various features, like the number of properties that exist in the suburb, land size, building size, governing council for the area, real estate agent, price of the house, etc.

dataset has details of 6830 house entries with the following 16 features

After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of how to build a regularized regression model. In this project, you will apply the following concepts.

Train-test split

Correlation between the features

Linear Regression

Polynomial Regressor

Lasso Regressor
